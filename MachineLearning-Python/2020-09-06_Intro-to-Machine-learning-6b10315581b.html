                It is very important to keep in mind that the accuracy of a

                Linear regression will do better when the underlying
                relationship between your variables and the response is known to
                be linear.

                However, in many cases this just doesn’t hold. Especially for
                classification problems. Imagine a high level algorithm that
                detects faces based on other features. A sensible rule it could
                learn is “if it has 2 eyes, a nose, and a mouth then it’s a
                face”. A linear regression model might conclude however that if
                it saw 3 eyes instead of two then it is even more likely to be a
                face. Or maybe all it detected were 12 mouths — no eyes or nose
                but if you multiply the contribution of a mouth by 12 then you
                get a “face” score even higher than a normal face. Clearly in
                this situation there is a nonlinear relationship between how
                much of a Face something is and the number of facial components
                and so a neural network would do better.

                There is a small but important difference in the kind of
                predictions that we should produce in different scenarios. While
                for example the nearest neighbor classifier chooses a class
                label for any item out of a given set of alternatives (like
                spam/ham, or 0,1,2,…,9), linear regression produces a numerical
                prediction that is not constrained to be an integer (a whole
                number as opposed to something like 3.14). So linear regression
                is better suited in situations where the output variable can be
                any number like the price of a product, the distance to an
                obstacle, the box-office revenue of the next Star Wars movie,
                and so on.

                is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the
                dependent variable is dichotomous (binary). Like all regression
                analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.
                Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the
                relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or
                more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent
                variables.

                the same products are placed nearer each other than customers

                food enthusiasts’, ‘high-end fish lovers’, ‘soda and pizza 6

                would only group the customers into clusters, but it wouldn’t
                automatically generate the cluster labels (‘fish lovers’ and so

                The nearest neighbor classifier is among the simplest possible
                classifiers. When given an item to classify, it finds the
                training data item that is most similar to the new item, and
                outputs its label.

                Machine learning applications of linear regression

                Linear regression is truly the workhorse of many AI and data
                science applications. It has its limits but they are often
                compensated by its simplicity, interpretability and efficiency.
                Linear regression has been successfully used in the following
                problems to give a few examples:

                The limits of machine learning
              </h3>
              <p name="991f" id="991f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                To summarize, machine learning is a very powerful tool for
                building AI applications. In addition to the nearest neighbor
                method, linear regression, and logistic regression, there are
                literally hundreds, if not thousands, of different machine
                learning techniques, but they all boil down to the same thing:
                trying to extract patterns and dependencies from data and using
                them either to gain understanding of a phenomenon or to predict
                future outcomes.
              </p>
              <p name="c4af" id="c4af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Machine learning can be a very hard problem and we can’t usually
                achieve a perfect method that would always produce the correct
                label. However, in most cases, a good but not perfect prediction
                is still better than none. Sometimes we may be able to produce
                better predictions by ourselves but we may still prefer to use
                machine learning because the machine will make its predictions
                faster and it will also keep churning out predictions without
                getting tired. Good examples are recommendation systems that
                need to predict what music, what videos, or what ads are more
                likely to be of interest to you.

                  The hardness of the task: in handwritten digit recognition, if
                  the digits are written very sloppily, even a human can’t
                  always guess correctly what the writer intended

                Load balancing is to distribute a large number of requests to
                different servers, to ease the burden of a single server.
                Load-balancing technology can balance conflicting factors such
                as cost, performance, and scalability, through a relatively low
                total cost of the computer cluster to achieve a strong
                performance that can not be achieved by stand-alone system. As a
                result of the introduction of load balancing, network and
                resources can be best made use of.

                “Layer 4 load balancing” most commonly refers to a deployment
                where the load balancer’s IP address is the one advertised to
                clients for a web site or service (via DNS, for example). As a
                result, clients record the load balancer’s address as the
                destination IP address in their requests.
              </p>
              <p name="38c6" id="38c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                When the Layer 4 load balancer receives a request and makes the
                load balancing decision, it also performs Network Address
                Translation (NAT) on the request packet, changing the recorded
                destination IP address from its own to that of the content
                server it has chosen on the internal network. Similarly, before
                forwarding server responses to clients, the load balancer
                changes the source address recorded in the packet header from
                the server’s IP address to its own. (The destination and source
                TCP port numbers recorded in the packets are sometimes also
                changed in a similar way.)
              </p>

                Layer 4 load balancers make their routing decisions based on
                address information extracted from the first few packets in the
                TCP stream, and do not inspect packet content. A Layer 4 load
                balancer is often a dedicated hardware device supplied by a
                vendor and runs proprietary load-balancing software, and the NAT
                operations might be performed by specialized chips rather than
                in software.

                Layer 4 load balancing was a popular architectural approach to
                traffic handling when commodity hardware was not as powerful as
                it is now, and the interaction between clients and application
                servers was much less complex. It requires less computation than
                more sophisticated load balancing methods (such as Layer 7), but
                CPU and memory are now sufficiently fast and cheap that the
                performance advantage for Layer 4 load balancing has become
                negligible or irrelevant in most situations.

                Layer 7 load balancing enables ADC (Application Delivery
                Controllers) to redirect traffic more intelligently by
                inspecting content to gain deeper context on the application
                request. This additional context allows the ADC to not only
                optimize load balancing but to also rewrite content, perform
                security inspections and to implement access controls.

                An Example of Layer 7 Load Balancing
              </h3>
              <p name="a39f" id="a39f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                Let’s look at a simple example. A user visits a high-traffic
                website. Over the course of the user’s session, he or she might
                request static content such as images or video, dynamic content
                such as a news feed, and even transactional information such as
                order status. Layer 7 load balancing allows the load balancer to
                route a request based on information in the request itself, such
                as what kind of content is being requested. So now a request for
                an image or video can be routed to the servers that store it and
                are highly optimized to serve up multimedia content. Requests
                for transactional information such as a discounted price can be
                routed to the application server responsible for managing
                pricing. With Layer 7 load balancing, network and application
                architects can create a highly tuned and optimized server
                infrastructure or application delivery network that is both
                reliable and efficiently scales to meet demand.
